# 100projects

I am documenting 100 easy and useful project using JavaScript (with HTML/CSS).

My definition of easy: the code behind the project simple to explain to someone who new to the field.

My definition of useful: the product should be something that has a real life application that you or someone you know might want to use in the future.

Project 1: A useful To-Do List

The idea behind this project was to create a basic ‘to-do’ list that could be used to take note of your daily priorities. The list works with your browser’s local storage, which means it does not clear when you reload it. It also has a filter feature which allows you to sort through the tasks. This project is just a slightly modified version of Brad Traversy’s one featured in ‘Modern JavaScript from the beginning’ Udemy course.
