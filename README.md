# 100projects

I am documenting 100 easy and useful project using JavaScript (with HTML/CSS) over a period of 6 months.

My definition of easy: the code behind the project simple to explain to someone who new to the field. 

My definition of useful: the product should be something that has a real life application that you or someone you know might want to use in the future.

Project 1: To Do List

This is a basic to-do list with who components 1) filter 2) save to local storage
